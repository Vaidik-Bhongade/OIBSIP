# EmailSpamDetetion

Weve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, 
is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, 
scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. 
Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. 


# DataSet

The Spam SMS dataset contains labeled SMS messages that are categorized as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). This dataset is commonly used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially for training and testing spam detection models
